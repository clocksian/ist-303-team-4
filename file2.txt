An empty street, an empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone, the rooms are getting

smaller.
I wonder how, I wonder why, I wonder
where they are

The days we had, the songs we sang
together.(oh yeah)

And all my love, I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue, to see you once
again... my love.
